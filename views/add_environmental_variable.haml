%h1 Add Environmental Variable

%p
  We will set an environmental variable to configuration an application's access to the
  database.

  %li 
    %p
      In MongoHQ, go to the "Admin Page" for your database, and select the "Mongo URI"
    %img{src: "/images/screenshots/admin.png"}

  %li
    %p
      In OpenShift, we will assign the "Mongo URI" to the
      %span.code MONGO_URL
      environmental variable.  The application will use the connection string to access
      the database.  Replace the
      %em &lt;user&gt;
      and 
      %em &lt;password&gt;
      place holders with the values set in the prior step.

    %p
      Your MongoDB connection string will be different than the one given.  We will 
      check your settings on the next step. For more information on the 
      %span.code rhc
      command line tool from OpenShift, see 
      %a{href: "https://www.openshift.com/developers/rhc-client-tools-install"} https://www.openshift.com/developers/rhc-client-tools-install
      = "."

  %li
    Restart your OpenShift application
